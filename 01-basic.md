1.Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment
2.It runs on V8 js engine

>> A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.
>> it provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking (Its based on non blocking paradigms)

>> It suppprts both CommonJS and ES modules (since NodeJs v12) , this means we can use both import and require in NodeJs.

## Popular JS Engine
V8 - Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge
SpiderMonkey - Firefox
Javascript Core(Nitro) - Safari
Chakra - Microsoft Edge

>> V8 is written on c++
>> Since 2009 Js is not only interpreting language but also compile language due to add of SpiderMonkey js compiler to Firefox 3.5.
>> JavaScript is internally compiled by V8 with just-in-time (JIT) compilation to speed up the execution.
